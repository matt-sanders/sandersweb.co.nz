One of Nota's products allows users to supply a video stream for Nota to monitor for a set of configurable criteria. This presented so many technical challenges; scaling, wild inconsistencies between streams ( looking at you HLS! ), rapid feedback requirements, and the list goes on.

There was a lot of knowledge sharing going into this project and lots of learning from all involved. We ultimately came away with a solution that was able to scale up and down based on changes to video quality and demand, and worked to surface information back to users quickly.
