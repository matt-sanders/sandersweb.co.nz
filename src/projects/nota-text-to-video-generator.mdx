Nota wanted users to quickly and easily create a video based on long form content. It was a big ask. The idea was to allow journalists and publishers to provide an article they had written and auto-magically turn that into a video.

We managed to achieve this by connecting a variety of services. After ingesting the content, we used AI to analyse the content and build the story line. The storyline was used to create images with a diffusion model ( e.g. Dall-E, StableDiffusion, etc ), or we'd use images provided by the user. All of that content was then transferred to a video editing studio where users could fine tune their video and render the final output in a variety of aspect ratios, for distribution across multiple platforms ( i.e. YouTube, TikTok, etc ).
