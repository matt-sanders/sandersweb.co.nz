summary: An article recommendation engine to suggest articles to users.
---

The Doe's mission was to break echo chambers and challenge its users with unique perspectives. Part of being able to do that was to surface content to its users that they may not otherwise read. And to achieve that, we were tasked to build a recommendation engine.

Firstly we used NLP to analyse each article and expose the underlying values present in the article. This analysis was provided by a third party API. Once we had the content analysed we gathered similar information from our users. This was primarily done through a short quiz that users could take where they provided us a mix of multi-choice and free-text responses. We'd also keep track of their reading history and preferences.

With an analysis available from both our users and our content, we were then able to create an engine that surfaced content that both challenged and supported our user's reading preferences. We'd suggest articles that were specifically highlighted to challenge the user, as well as suggesting articles that supported their views.

These recommendations were all made available via an API and were displayed on the user's dashboard. [Read more about the publication site](/projects/the-doe-publication-website).
