The Doe wanted a publication website where users could read verified stories published by anonymous authors. For the most part this was relatively straightforward; we migrated an initial Vue/Nuxt project to React/Next, content was pulled from a CMS ( Prismic ) and most of the content was statically generated using Next's static generation functionality.

Some complexity was introduced with membership. Users needed to be able to sign up and pay what they wanted on a recurring monthly membership. We integrated with Stripe to do this. Then content was gated depending on your membership type. Free users could read _n_ articles a month, while paid users had access to more, along with other benefits.

Paid users could also make use of "insights", which was the recommendation engine we built. [Read more about the recommendation engine project](/projects/the-doe-recommendation-engine). These were displayed to the user on their user dashboard, a dynamically rendered page that showed information specific to the user.

Articles were indexed in Algolia and that powered our search. We chose to implement our own search UI as The Doe had a very specific brand guideline.
