summary: A web app for Nota's suite of publishing tools.
---

Nota provides AI tools for publishers. I was the lead developer tasked with making those tools accessible to their users. This meant wearing a variety of hats, but most common was building the APIs to support the functionality they needed, as well as building the corresponding UI.

I worked very closely with product and design to ensure that what we were building would work the way it was intended to, and to help guide product and design toward development best practices.

In this case the web app did not need to be SEO friendly, but we still built with a focus on semantics and accessibility best practices as these generally end up resulting in a better overall experience anyway.

Content was restricted to paying users, so we integrated with Auth0 to ensure that only members could only access the parts of the app that they had been granted access to.
